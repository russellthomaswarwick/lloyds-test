#  Code Test Summary

We would like you to design a simple Weather application. Forecast can be found using the https://openweathermap.org/ API. You can register a free account to get your API key.
We would like you to spend around 2 hours on this task and get as far as you can. Rather than a complete solution, weâ€™re looking for how you structure your code, project and files.

The Task
Requirements:
Build one screen showing the weather for the users current location. Please show todays weather along with a high level weekly forecast.
Build the UI however you see fit, try to follow UI/UX practices from the Android/iOS platform
Handle the location permissions request for the user, this includes the user denying access to location. Use the appropriate guidelines for the latest system version.

Notes
Focus on good practices, modelling data, architecture, not blocking threads etc Consider an offline first approach
Use any libraries that are required for the solution but be mindful of bringing in loads of third party libraries. This is a short task and likely getting the project setup with a handful of dependencies will just slow you down in the short term. For android (JSON serialisation libraries and support libraries are would be acceptable, retrofit, dagger, etc are discouraged)
If you would have changed anything given more time, please comment how you might have done it differently. Add a readme file or comment in the code directly.
